<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Once you have successfully folded multiple airplanes of each design, you will fly them and record your findings. As with any experiment, there are tons of variables that can be measured, each of which will contribute to the design's title as "best". And, like other experiments, multiple attempts must be done to ensure that your results are accurate. So, start by making 3 paper airplanes for each design. Once you have done this, read through the log to get a feel for what should be measured in every test.</p>
