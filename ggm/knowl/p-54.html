<p>An owl, toad, and raccoon bought raffle tickets. Later they gathered to watch the raffle number drawings. However, the lights went out during the party, and one of the animals tripped into the other animals causing them to all fall to the ground with their raffle tickets. When the power came back on, they found out one of the raffle tickets was the grand-prize winner, but they did not know who bought it.</p>
